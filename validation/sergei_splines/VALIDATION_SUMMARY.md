# Sergei Splines Validation Summary

## Status Overview

### ✅ **1D Splines - WORKING CORRECTLY**
- All orders (3, 4, 5) work correctly
- Python implementation matches Fortran reference
- Order 5 (quintic) fixed and validated
- Excellent interpolation quality

### ❌ **2D Splines - BUG IDENTIFIED**
- **Critical Issue**: Sign flip and magnitude errors in evaluation
- **Root Cause**: Coefficient storage/access pattern mismatch between construction and evaluation
- **Impact**: RMS error ~7.06e-01 instead of expected ~1e-02
- **Comparison**: Fortran reference gives correct results (RMS ~2.4e-04)

## Detailed Findings

### 1D Validation Results
```
Order 3: ✓ Working perfectly
Order 4: ✓ Working perfectly  
Order 5: ✓ Fixed and working (was hardcoded for n=10, now general)
```

### 2D Problem Analysis
**Test Case**: sin(π*x) * cos(π*y) on 8×8 grid
**Problem Point**: (0.8, 0.3)
- **Expected**: 0.345492
- **Python FastSpline**: -0.656598 (ERROR: 1.002090)
- **Fortran Reference**: 0.345249 (ERROR: 0.000243)
- **SciPy Reference**: 0.345389 (ERROR: 0.000102)

### Technical Details

#### Coefficient Storage Layout
Python uses flattened 1D array with indexing:
```python
coeff[k1*(o2+1)*n1*n2 + k2*n1*n2 + i1*n2 + i2]
```

Fortran uses 4D array:
```fortran
coeff(0:order(1), 0:order(2), num_points(1), num_points(2))
```

#### Construction Process
- **Step 1**: 1D splines along dimension 2 (y-direction)
- **Step 2**: 1D splines along dimension 1 (x-direction) for each coefficient

#### Evaluation Process
- **Fortran**: Correct tensor product evaluation
- **Python**: Attempted to match Fortran but has indexing/order issues

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Fix coefficient storage layout** in Python 2D construction
2. **Verify evaluation order** matches Fortran exactly
3. **Test with simple functions** (linear, quadratic) to isolate issue
4. **Implement comprehensive 2D validation** suite

### Verification Strategy
1. Start with simple linear function z = x + y (should be exact)
2. Test quadratic functions z = x² + y² + xy
3. Compare coefficient arrays between Python and Fortran
4. Validate evaluation step-by-step

## Current Status
- **1D Splines**: Production ready ✅
- **2D Splines**: Needs debugging before use ❌
- **3D Splines**: Not tested (likely similar issues)

## Performance Notes
- SciPy is faster for small grids due to optimized FORTRAN routines
- FastSpline provides direct coefficient access and works for higher orders
- When 2D is fixed, FastSpline should provide excellent 2D interpolation

## Files Modified
- `src/fastspline/sergei_splines.py`: 1D quintic fix, 2D evaluation attempt
- `validation/sergei_splines/`: Comprehensive test suite created

## Test Coverage
- ✅ 1D interpolation (orders 3, 4, 5)
- ✅ 1D derivatives
- ✅ Boundary conditions
- ✅ Systematic coefficient validation
- ❌ 2D interpolation (bug identified)
- ❌ 3D interpolation (not tested)
