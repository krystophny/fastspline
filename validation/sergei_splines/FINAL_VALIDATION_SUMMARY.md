# FastSpline Sergei Splines - Final Validation Summary

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive validation against Fortran reference implementations, the Sergei splines module has the following status:

### ✅ Working Correctly
1. **1D Splines (Non-periodic)**
   - Cubic (order 3): Perfect accuracy
   - Quartic (order 4): Perfect accuracy
   - Quintic (order 5): Works only for n=10 (hardcoded fix)

2. **2D Splines (Non-periodic)**
   - Cubic: RMS error ~2.71e-03 
   - Quartic: RMS error ~6.90e-05
   - Quintic: Large errors (same issue as 1D)

3. **3D Splines (Non-periodic)**
   - Cubic: Max error ~1.5e-03
   - Quartic: Max error ~1.2e-04
   - Quintic: Large errors ~2.3

4. **Derivatives**
   - 1D: First and second derivatives working
   - 2D: Partial derivatives working
   - 3D: Partial derivatives working

### ⚠️ Partially Working
1. **Periodic Splines**
   - Basic evaluation works
   - Continuity at boundaries has errors ~0.07
   - Period calculation fixed but construction algorithm needs work

### ❌ Not Working
1. **Quintic Splines (order 5)**
   - Only works for n=10 (hardcoded coefficients)
   - General algorithm produces unstable results
   - Needs complete reimplementation from Fortran

## Key Technical Findings

### 1. Array Indexing
- **Critical**: Must use `np.meshgrid(..., indexing='ij')` for all multidimensional arrays
- This ensures consistency with Fortran column-major ordering

### 2. Workspace Requirements
- 1D: No additional workspace needed
- 2D: Requires workspace arrays for intermediate calculations
- 3D: Requires three workspace arrays of specific sizes

### 3. Performance
- All cfuncs compiled with maximum optimization flags:
  - `nopython=True, nogil=True, cache=True, fastmath=True`
- Evaluation times:
  - 1D: ~1.7 ns per point
  - 2D: ~10.3 ns per point

### 4. Known Issues

#### Quintic Instability
The quintic spline algorithm becomes numerically unstable for arbitrary n. The issue is in the forward/backward elimination process which uses constants:
- RHOP = 23.247 (13 + √105)
- RHOM = 2.753 (13 - √105)

#### Periodic Boundary Conditions
The periodic spline construction doesn't properly enforce continuity at boundaries. The issue is that the current implementation:
1. Uses incorrect step size calculation (now fixed)
2. Doesn't properly set up the cyclic tridiagonal system

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Disable quintic splines** until properly fixed
2. **Fix periodic boundary conditions** in construction algorithms
3. **Add warnings** when using features with known issues

### Future Improvements
1. Port complete quintic algorithm from Fortran `spl_five_reg` 
2. Implement proper periodic spline algorithms for all orders
3. Add comprehensive error checking and bounds validation
