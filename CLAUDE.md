This file provides **MANDATORY** guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

**⚠️ CRITICAL: YOU MUST ADHERE TO ALL PRINCIPLES BELOW ⚠️**
These are not suggestions - they are strict requirements that MUST be followed in every code change. In particular:

1. Test-Driven Development
2. SOLID, KISS and DRY
3. Single responsibility principle

**⚠️ COMMUNICATION REQUIREMENTS ⚠️**
- Keep responses minimal and direct
- No flattery, congratulations, or celebration language
- Be brutally honest about issues and mistakes
- Answer questions with facts only
- Skip explanations unless specifically requested

**⚠️ WORK ETHICS ⚠️**
- Always prioritize correctness and clarity
- Never be lazy or take shortcuts

**⚠️ DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW ⚠️**
1. First collect the problem and solution strategy in a github issue
2. Tackle one issue at a time
3. Write tests first, then implement code to pass tests
4. Once tests pass, clean up code while keeping tests green
5. Commit, push, close the issue
