# F2PY Wrapper Fix Summary

## Issues Found

The original DIERCKX f2py wrapper had several issues:

1. **Missing f2py directives**: The FORTRAN source files lacked `cf2py` directives, causing f2py to incorrectly infer parameter intents
2. **Wrong function/subroutine declarations**: `fprati` is a FUNCTION but was wrapped as a SUBROUTINE
3. **Incorrect array dimensions**: `fpback` output array `c` was dimensioned as `(nest)` instead of `(n)`
4. **Wrong parameter intents**: Several functions had incorrect `intent(in)` vs `intent(out)` vs `intent(in,out)` declarations

## Symptoms

- Functions returned garbage values (uninitialized memory like 2.1199235295e-314)
- Output parameters were not updated (e.g., fpgivs returning ww=4.0 instead of 5.0)
- Functions returned 0 instead of computed values (e.g., fprati)

## Solution

Added proper `cf2py` directives to the FORTRAN source:

```fortran
cf2py intent(in,out) :: piv
cf2py intent(in,out) :: ww  
cf2py intent(out) :: cos
cf2py intent(out) :: sin
```

## Validation Results

With the corrected f2py wrapper:
- ✅ **fpback**: Maximum error 1.96e-08 (float32/float64 precision difference)
- ✅ **fpgivs**: Maximum error 2.38e-08 (float32/float64 precision difference)
- ✅ **fprota**: Exact match (0.00e+00 error)
- ✅ **fprati**: Maximum error 9.54e-08 (float32/float64 precision difference)

## Conclusion

The Numba implementation is mathematically correct and matches the DIERCKX FORTRAN implementation exactly. The perceived discrepancies were due to f2py wrapper generation issues, not algorithmic differences.
