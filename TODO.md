# FastSpline TODO

## Current Status

### Completed ✅
- [x] **1D Sergei Splines - PRODUCTION READY**
  - ✅ All orders (3, 4, 5) working correctly
  - ✅ Cubic, quartic, and quintic splines fully implemented
  - ✅ Python implementation matches Fortran reference exactly
  - ✅ Periodic and non-periodic boundary conditions
  - ✅ Derivatives support (first and second derivatives)
  - ✅ Comprehensive validation suite in `validation/sergei_splines/`
  - ✅ Memory alignment issues completely resolved
  - ✅ Quintic splines fixed from hardcoded n=10 to general implementation

### Critical Issues ❌
- [x] **2D Sergei Splines - BUG IDENTIFIED**
  - ❌ **CRITICAL**: Sign flip and magnitude errors in evaluation
  - ❌ RMS error ~7.06e-01 instead of expected ~1e-02
  - ❌ Python gives -0.656598 vs expected 0.345492 at test point (0.8, 0.3)
  - ✅ Root cause identified: Coefficient storage/access pattern mismatch
  - ✅ Fortran reference works correctly (error ~2.4e-04)
  - 🔧 **NEEDS FIX**: Tensor product coefficient indexing between construction and evaluation

### In Progress 🔧
- [ ] **Fix 2D Spline Implementation**
  - ✅ Comprehensive debugging completed
  - ✅ Problem isolated to coefficient storage layout
  - ❌ Coefficient construction vs evaluation mismatch
  - ❌ Tensor product evaluation order issues
  - Next: Fix coefficient storage to match Fortran reference

## Current Priority

**Fix 2D Sergei Splines Critical Bug**

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Fix coefficient storage layout** in Python 2D construction
2. **Match Fortran tensor product order** exactly  
3. **Verify evaluation indexing** matches construction
4. **Test with linear functions** first (should be exact)

### Verification Strategy
1. Start with simple z = x + y (should reproduce exactly)
2. Compare coefficient arrays between Python and Fortran
3. Debug tensor product evaluation step-by-step
4. Validate against Fortran reference implementation

## Validation Framework Status

The validation suite (`validation/sergei_splines/`) includes:
- ✅ Comprehensive 1D validation (all orders working)
- ✅ Fortran reference implementation 
- ✅ Python vs Fortran comparison tools
- ✅ 2D problem identification and debugging tools
- ❌ 2D splines fix pending
- ❌ 3D splines not tested (likely similar issues)
