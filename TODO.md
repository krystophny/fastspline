## Implementation Order

1. Start with simplified version (fixed knots, no smoothing)
2. Add QR decomposition for least squares
3. Implement knot insertion algorithm
4. Add smoothing parameter selection
5. Optimize with Numba
6. Fine-tune performance

## Key Challenges

1. **Knot Placement**: The automatic knot placement algorithm is complex and requires careful implementation of the error estimation and knot insertion strategies.

2. **Numerical Stability**: QR decomposition with Givens rotations must be implemented carefully to maintain numerical stability.

3. **Performance**: Achieving significant speedup over SciPy while maintaining accuracy requires aggressive optimization.

4. **Tensor Product Structure**: Efficiently exploiting the tensor product structure of B-splines is crucial for performance.
